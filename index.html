      <h1> Design & Presentation</h1>
      <h3>CUNY J-School Spring 2014 | Thurs 6-8:50 | Room 438 | <a href="mailto:lena.groeger@journalism.cuny.edu">Lena Groeger</a></h3>

      <p>This course will cover the fundamentals of good presentation, layout, and design for print and the web. We'll cover basic typography, color theory, page layout, information design as well as navigation and usability. We'll explore a variety of online tools, get comfortable with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and introduce the languages of web design: HTML and CSS. By the end of this course you'll be able to recognize poor designs and identify how to fix them, as well as create your own designs with better organization, unity, and clarity.</p>

      <h2>Basic Design Principles</h2>
        <p>The things you need to keep in mind for every single project, from poster to news graphic.</p>

      </div>


      <h4>In Class</h4>
      <p>We'll cover the four basic design principles to live by (at the end of this class you'll be very very very familiar with them.) They come straight from one of my all-time favorite design books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Robin-Williams/dp/0321534042">The Non- Designers Design Book</a> by Robin Williams (not the actor). We'll look at examples from print and online, inside and out of the newsroom, big and small, festive and serious. We'll also do some in class design exercises and critiques to get you thinking about why &#8212; and how &#8212; design can be used to better organize, unify, and present your ideas.</p>

      <span class="small"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Robin-Williams/dp/0321534042"><img src="img/non-designers.jpg"/></a></span>

        <p>4. Contrast <span>p 65-60</span></p>
        </div>




      <h4>After Class</h4>
      <p>Do this:</p>
      <p>Take a resume (preferably your own). Applying the four design principles we talked about today, redesign that resume. <a href="mailto:lgroeger@gmail.com">Send it to me</a> before next week's class.</p>

      <h2>Type, Color, and The Grid</h2>
      <p>How to organize the bits and pieces of any design&#8212; typefaces, colors, words, pictures, columns, units, etc &#8212; to create a unifed whole. Plus an introduction to Illustrator. </p>

      <h4>In Class</h4>
      <p>We'll talk about how good typography and organized layouts can help you build better designs that inform, inspire, entertain and above all, communicate ideas clearly. We'll cover the basics of type classification (you know, the serif and sans-serif stuff), talk about some do's and don'ts of font choices and combinations, and review bits of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-2nd-revised-expanded/dp/1568989695">Thinking with Type</a> by Ellen Lupton.</p>


        <span class="small"><a href ="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-2nd-revised-expanded/dp/1568989695"><img src="img/thinking-type.jpg"/></a></span>

        <p>Hierarchy <span>p 94-95</span> </p>
        </div>

        <p>We'll talk a little bit about color theory and how to pick color schemes (with a few online tools its not too hard to find gorgeous and informative color combinations). One of the best places to start is <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/">Color Brewer</a> by Cynthia Brewer. We'll also delve into a very practical idea and technique for building great designs: the grid. We'll talk about units, columns and thirds, and how to go about translating those grids from paper to the web. We'll look at lots of examples from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Layout-Workbook-Real-World-Building-Graphic/dp/1592533523/">Layout Workbook</a> by Kristin Cullen.</p>

         <span class="small"><a href ="http://www.amazon.com/Layout-Workbook-Real-World-Building-Graphic/dp/1592533523/"><img src="img/layoutworkbook.jpg"/></a></span>

        <br>

        <p>To try it all out, we're gonna jump right into grid-based design in Adobe Illustrator. Download <a href="AiIntro.pdf">this introductory tutorial</a> from BGSU and <a href="grid.ai">this Illustrator file</a> to get started. Here is a more detailed explanation of <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/illustrator/cs/using/WS14386A18-6B9B-436d-8FF1-B98770564424.html">Illustrator tools</a>.</p>




      <h4>After Class</h4>
      <p>Do this:<p>
      <p>Using the Illustrator tools we covered in class, re-create <a href="img/subtraction.jpg">this</a> as best you possibly can (hint: start by breaking it up into lines, squares, and text-boxes, and repeat). It's actually the homepage of <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/">designer Khoi Vinh</a>, who <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2004/12/31/grid-computi">relied heavily on a grid-based system</a> for his website</a>, and <a href="http://vimeo.com/31355402">talks about grids</a>  often.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Watch this:<p>
      <p>Get introduced to HTML and CSS! Watch Part 2-6 of the <a href="http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/">Don't Fear the Internet video series</a>. If you've got the basics down already, take a stab at recreating the design you just made in Illustrator into an actual web page. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Send me this:<p>
      <p>1 to 2 ideas for your final project. Remember this can be a new project (I'd highly recommend building yourself an online portfolio if you don't already have one) or a project that you've been assigned in another class that could benefit from a design overhaul.</p>

      <h4>Before CLASS</h4>
      <p>Make sure you have the following:</p>
      <p>A text editor like <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html">TextWrangler</a> (free), <a href"http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> or <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></p>

      <p>The latest version of <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a></p>

      <h4>In CLASS</h4>
      <p>We're going to jump right into how to structure and style webpages with HTML and CSS. We'll review the basics so you're comfortable with everything from <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags to CSS classes. Then we'll create our very own web page from scratch.</p>

        <span class="small"><img src="img/html.jpg"/></span>

        <h4>HTML</h4>

        </div>


      <p>We'll meet the web inspector, which is basically like viewing the source code of a web page but much more awesome. We'll fiddle around with some existing web pages to alter some text, change styles and find image url's or raw data. Finally, we'll use Adobe Photoshop to do some image correction and created optimized images for the web.</p>

        <h3>CLASS FOUR | Monday, May 19th | 5-7:50</h3>
        <h2>Interaction Design, Usability & Navigation</h2>
        <p>How to approach design from the user's perspective.</p>

      </div>

        <h4>IN Class</h4>
        <p>We'll talk about how to create clear and intuitive designs for better user experiences. We'll focus on the basics: how to convey the basic idea of a page (what is this?), orient the user (where am I?), and make sure functions are self-evident (what do I do here?). We'll cover some common mistakes to avoid and a few easy steps to ensure usable interfaces and good navigation. </p>

        <br>
        <p>We'll start with some principles from a must-read book for anyone who deals with design and technology in the world (or has trouble opening doors): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0465067107">The Design of Everyday Things</a> by Donald Norman. I promise that in addition to doors, you will never look at stovetops or teapots the same way.</p>

        </div>

        <p>We'll talk about the value in signposts and breadcrumbs, how to use visual hierarchy to tell users the big idea, and why you should probably stick to conventions (something about a wheel and re-inventing). We'll look at some examples from something more web-specific: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758">Don't Make Me Think</a> by Steve Krug.</p>

        <span class="small"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758"><img src="img/dontmakemethink.jpg"/></a></span>

        </div>
        <br>

      <h4>After Class</h4>
      <p>Keep working on your projects. If it's a print project in Illustrator, Photoshop or InDesign, think about how to get as far as you can with just the simple tools we talked about. You can go far with just the rectangle and type tool! If it's an online project or portfolio, think about how users will navigate between elements smoothly (will they scroll? click through?) Think about what you want users to see first and how you want to display your work (all at once? in a slideshow?). Try applying each of the 4 design principles in turn, consider font choices and color, and think about how to make interactions simple and intuitive.</a></p>
